Q2:

Output:
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8

Explanation:
In C++, "sizeof()" is an operator which returns a number indicating how many bytes used for the target type.

To check the operating system, I commanded "uname -u". The output is x86_64, reflecting a 64-bit system.
Following are sizes on a 64-bit operating system for the types mentioned in this question.

"char":             	1 byte
"pointer of char":  	8 bytes
"int":              	4 bytes
"pointer of int": 	8 bytes
"float":	        4 bytes
"pointer of float":	8 bytes
"double":		8 bytes
"pointer of double": 	8 bytes

As a result, the output is reasonable.
